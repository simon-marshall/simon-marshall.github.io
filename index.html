            <p>Hi, I'm a final year PhD student at Universiteit Leiden and I'm interested in transitioning to work
                in AI alignment. </p>

            <p> My PhD dissertation is mostly focused on my contributions to quantum computing, in topics from quantum complexity theory to 
                quantum machine learning and circuit cutting. My personal favourite from this line of research
                is a paper coming out next month, where we provide the strongest conditions currently known that quantum
                computers can compute functions that classical computers can not.</p>
            <p> Outside my PhD I completed a wonderful piece of research with <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=B027ViYAAAAJ&hl=en"> Jan Kirchner</a> 
                using information theory to analyse how models may encode information and how interpretable these
                encodings would be. I was also involved with the first round of what became 
                <a href="https://metr.org/"> METR Evals</a>, assessing the risk posed by modern LLMs.
                <p> Before this I was aligned as an undergraduate in Maths+Physics at Warwick University,
                    where I completed my Master dissertation in fluid dynamics under <a href= "https://jamessprittles.com/">
                    James Sprittles </a>. Through this connection, I can trace my mathematical genealogy back to Poisson,
                    Cauchy, Lagrange, Laplace and Euler. I have an Erd≈ës number of 4 through a collaboration with Scott 
                    Aaronson and a Bacon number of Infinity that I don't get from a collaboration with Jack Nicholson.
                    I am open to any collaboration that would lower either of these numbers.</p>

            <p> I grew in the south of England in a lovely town 40 minutes from Waterloo station. At university I was convinced of the importance of the alignment problem
                and moved to Holland at 22 to pursue a PhD. I've been a proud member of the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">the 10% pledge</a> for
                5 years and a vegeterian for 7.</p>
